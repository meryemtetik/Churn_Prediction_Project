    "\n",

    "The HR dataset has 14,999 samples. In the given dataset, you have two types of employee one who stayed and another who left the company.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can describe 10 attributes in detail as:\n",
    "- ***satisfaction_level:*** It is employee satisfaction point, which ranges from 0-1.\n",
    "- ***last_evaluation:*** It is evaluated performance by the employer, which also ranges from 0-1.\n",
    "- ***number_projects:*** How many of projects assigned to an employee?\n",
    "- ***average_monthly_hours:*** How many hours in averega an employee worked in a month?\n",
    "- **time_spent_company:** time_spent_company means employee experience. The number of years spent by an employee in the company.\n",
    "- ***work_accident:*** Whether an employee has had a work accident or not.\n",
    "- ***promotion_last_5years:*** Whether an employee has had a promotion in the last 5 years or not.\n",
    "- ***Departments:*** Employee's working department/division.\n",
    "- ***Salary:*** Salary level of the employee such as low, medium and high.\n",

However, you must provide the K-means algorithm with information about the number of clusters it will make predictions. Also, the data you apply to the K-means algorithm must be scaled. In order to find the optimal number of clusters, you are asked to use the ***Elbow method***. Briefly, try to predict the set to which individuals are related by using K-means and evaluate the estimation results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the data is ready to be applied to the model, you must ***split the data into train and test***. Then build a model to predict whether employees will churn or not. Train your models with your train set, test the success of your model with your test set. \n",

    "Try to make your predictions by using the algorithms ***Logistic Regression***, ***Random Forest Classifier***, ***XGBoost Classifier***, ***ANN***. You can use the related modules of the ***scikit-learn*** and ***Tensorflow-Keras*** library. You can use scikit-learn ***Classification Metrics*** module for accuracy calculation. You can use the ***Yellowbrick*** module for model selection and visualization.\n",

The value of k at which improvement in distortion declines the most is called the elbow, at which we should stop dividing the data into further clusters.\n",

Model Deployement helps you showcase your work to the world and make better decisions with it. But, deploying a model can get a little tricky at times. Before deploying the model, many things such as data storage, preprocessing, model building and monitoring need to be studied. Streamlit is a popular open source framework used by data scientists for model distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Deployment of machine learning models, means making your models available to your other business systems. By deploying models, other systems can send data to them and get their predictions, which are in turn populated back into the company systems. Through machine learning model deployment, can begin to take full advantage of the model you built.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data science is concerned with how to build machine learning models, which algorithm is more predictive, how to design features, and what variables to use to make the models more accurate. However, how these models are actually used is often neglected. And yet this is the most important step in the machine learning pipline. Only when a model is fully integrated with the business systems, real values ​​can be extract from its predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "After doing the following operations in this notebook, jump to new .py file and create your web app with Streamlit."
