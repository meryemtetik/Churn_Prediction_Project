    "You cooked the food in the kitchen and moved on to the serving stage. The question is how do you showcase your work to others? Model Deployement helps you showcase your work to the world and make better decisions with it. But, deploying a model can get a little tricky at times. Before deploying the model, many things such as data storage, preprocessing, model building and monitoring need to be studied. Streamlit is a popular open source framework used by data scientists for model distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Deployment of machine learning models, means making your models available to your other business systems. By deploying models, other systems can send data to them and get their predictions, which are in turn populated back into the company systems. Through machine learning model deployment, can begin to take full advantage of the model you built.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data science is concerned with how to build machine learning models, which algorithm is more predictive, how to design features, and what variables to use to make the models more accurate. However, how these models are actually used is often neglected. And yet this is the most important step in the machine learning pipline. Only when a model is fully integrated with the business systems, real values ​​can be extract from its predictions.\n",

    "After doing the following operations in this notebook, jump to new .py file and create your web app with Streamlit."
